# Introduction

My homelab is a versatile computing environment designed for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **self-hosting services**. It consists of servers, storage devices, networking gear, and various software solutions, all configured to simulate a real-world IT infrastructure. The primary purpose of the homelab is to expand my technical skills, explore new technologies, and manage personal projects in a controlled and private environment.

## General Goals

### 1. Learning and Skill Development
- The homelab serves as a hands-on platform for learning server management, virtualization, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and automation with tools like Ansible and Terraform. This environment allows me to practice real-world scenarios without the risk of impacting production systems.

### 2. Self-Hosting Services
- I use the homelab to host a variety of services, including media streaming (e.g., Plex or Jellyfin), file storage (NAS), password management (Vaultwarden), and more. By self-hosting these services, I gain complete control over my data, enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on third-party cloud services.

### 3. Backup and Disaster Recovery
- A major focus of my homelab is to implement a robust **backup** and **disaster recovery** strategy. By leveraging backup tools like Kopia or Restic, I ensure that my data is securely backed up and can be restored in case of hardware failure or data loss.

### 4. Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- My homelab provides an environment for experimenting with automation tools and workflows. I use Ansible and other IaC tools to automate server provisioning, application deployment, and maintenance tasks, aiming to build efficient, reproducible infrastructure.

### 5. Security and Network Management
- The homelab enables me to experiment with network security configurations, firewalls, VPNs (WireGuard, OpenVPN), and user authentication systems. This helps me enhance my understanding of cybersecurity principles while securing the services I run in my network.

### 6. Development and Testing
- The homelab also acts as a sandbox for development and testing projects. Whether experimenting with new software stacks, testing CI/CD pipelines, or deploying applications, it provides a controlled space for development activities.

## What I Aim to Achieve

The ultimate goal of my homelab is to create a reliable, secure, and flexible environment for both **learning** and **self-hosting**. It allows me to test cutting-edge technologies, gain deeper technical expertise, and manage critical personal infrastructure while building a system that reflects best practices in **IT management**, **automation**, and **security**.
